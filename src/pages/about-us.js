  <p css={{'@media (min-width: 100px)': {paddingLeft: "70px",
              paddingRight: "70px"}}}>All our products are sourced and designed by an experienced brewer with decades of experience in one of the worlds most well respected micro breweries. <br /> <br />
              Have you been let down by the poor quality and high cost of the brewing equipment available on the market? We were too. <br /> <br />
              With decades of experience in the brewing industry, weâ€™ve purchased, installed and used a lot of brewing equipment for our own brewery. Combined with a passion for brewing excellent beer, a few years later, BrewPlus was born.  <br /> <br />
              As expert brewers, we aim to provide top quality brewing equipment to our customers at excellent prices. If you like friendly, hard-working small business owners then look no further! <br /> <br />
              Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions. <br /> <br />
              Sam Franklin, Founder <br /></p>
